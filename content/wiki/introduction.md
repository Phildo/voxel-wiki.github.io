So, you want/need/must work with voxels and have no idea where to start, much less what exactly voxels are?

Well, you've come to the right place!

## What is a voxel?

To quote Wikipedia:

> In [3D computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics), a voxel represents a value on a [regular grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_grid) in [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space).
> <br>&mdash; *Wikipedia [on Voxels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel)*

That is... quite a mouthful, so let us simplify:

> A voxel is a value in a three-dimensional grid, like a pixel/texel is a value in a two-dimensional grid.

That's a voxel!

Now, you *might* be asking „*What kind of value?*‟, but sadly the answer to that depends *entirely* on what you wish to do with voxels! It might be colors, directions, states, 'types', etc. etc.; anything that can be meaningfully arranged in a grid, really.

Interestingly, the grid in question may have holes, be stretched, have multiple sizes... The only real requirement is that every `x,y,z`-coordinate consistently leads to one individual voxel value or an [up/down-sampled](/wiki/rendering/sampling) variant of it.

## What are voxels used for?

Many things, but three of them stick out: **Videogames**, **3D Modeling** and **Medicine**!

Since you are visiting this wiki, you might already know *what* you want to use voxels for; if not, please think about it now, or just read on ahead.

### Videogames

Want to create a videogame using voxels?

Then you'll have to decide whether you want to start [from scratch](/wiki/engines/from-scratch) or with a [game-engine](/wiki/engines/).

> **Note:** Starting from scratch requires *quite a bit* of knowledge about *many* different areas of programming. If you don't have *any* experience with 3D computer-graphics, or simply don't want to invest *literal years of your [non-infinite life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXeJANDKwDc)*, it might be best to start with a game engine instead.

#### Minecraft Clone?

If you do intend to create a voxel-based videogame, there is something you should be immediately aware of:

No matter what you do, your game *will* inevitably be compared to Minecraft... and that's okay! Copying other peoples ideas has been happening for quite literally thousands of years (basically forever), across all creative disciplines! Nothing these days is truly original, so don't worry about it and just create what *you* like!

### Modeling

Want to create 3D-models made out of voxels?

In this case, we highly recommend checking out [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=mv_main), which is considered the best voxel-editor you can get, at no cost!

### Medicine

**TODO**
