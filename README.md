[Voxel.Wiki](https://voxel.wiki/) is a website that is all about voxels: Values on regular grids in three-dimensional space!

This repository holds the contents of the website in the form of a [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) project.

Feel free to contribute! :)

1. [Install Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/), such that it is on your `PATH` or put it right in the projects directory.

If you're a maintainer (eg: you are part of the `voxel-wiki` organisation), you *may* directly push changes, as long as they don't affect too many pages. In the latter case, it's a better idea to do it trough a pull-request or a separate branch.
